# HOMELY food order application

A simulation of an Application where you can order and pay for food


 i used the following technologies:  React.js, Css, react-bootstrap, react-scroll, animation on scroll library, sweetalert.js library

I used React.js framework to bootstrap this project because of the limitless functionalities and flexibilities it brings to me, examples of the these are : 

- useContext hook which i used this to manage the state of some components in my application which includes the functioning cart system
- Props to pass some data from component to component with ease.
- Access to 3rd party libraries that made the app much better like react-scroll and react-bootstrap, 

I then used animation on scroll for the scroll animation and sweetalert for the order validation.

**Challenges**

The challenge i faced while building was using useContext to manage the app wide state, because i am more familiar with redux and redux toolkit for managing state.

**Features to be added**

This is the version 1.0 of the food order application but i hope to improve the app and make it even better in future versions. The features i will love to add are :

- A checkout form
- Implement a dummy flutterwave payment gateway
- Store user order in firebase
- Making the code more cleaner and improving the user experience.
- Css modules to prevent clashing of class names across components
